## Inflorescence types and leaf shapes


The type of images I like to use are about [inflorescence types](http://hsvbg.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Types-of-Inflorescence_N-Ontario-Plant-Database.pdf)

Simpler put, its about 'floral structure', or the way flowers are attached to stems.

offcourse another big point of vegetation, are the leaves, here's a collection of leaf shapes.

Anyway, when I was busy going deeper I got sidetracked, and ended up just using a static bunch of images with some variations in scale for the moment,  
I will come here again and use some fractal code to generate more complex vegetation.
