Thing is, he was called Nikolai, but not to me."


I am Nikki, the guy behind the curtain, located in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.  
I've studied Fine arts, sculpture and turned into a programmer around 2002,  
or remembered I was one since the 80's.  

I've been building little games and simulations as a hobby,  
and since I'm a father I am slowly moving in the direction of developing baby, toddler and children apps.
