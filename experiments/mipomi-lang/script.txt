    - Hi there.
    See these guys?
    I made them, they are in an app you can download for free, it doenst even have adds, its called mipo puppetmaker.
    BUt anyway, this inst an add for that app, this is just a good place to start...

    See how they are talking? They just say their own name, over and over again, Quite the narcissists if you ask me.
    Reminds me of many people , so pretty good really, BUT i want to improve this.


    I want to ... build a mouth-system, working mouths with lipsync and generated speech and well let's design alanguage tOO!


    Lets start with a simple mouth like thing that can move, makes for a better video if you can see things.
    we will use 8 points, split in 2 lips, add a bit of bezier curves and use a lerp to animate between these great shapes i found.

    Using this mouth of ours we can make it basically do everything, evey pose, every sounds, but that , we don't.
    Keeping a focus on the end goal is , important, and having limitations too. this is for these creates rememeber?

    What would they need? what are they takling about with each other? do they speak english ? nope.
    they have there own little language i thought
    with meaning, and simple toddler syllables.
    here we go.

    this is something for another video, and quite a nice little project of its own, but i feel its safe to say, i turned a bit into a
    language nerd, i rememeber learnig about Tolkien bakc in the day and how hey designed his own languagegs and thinking , what a nerd,
    here we are.

    So, now, we have mouth, because without it you cant speak
    and we have a lnagugae, because without it you just have sound.

    So finally we can get started with this video of ours.



    Lets satrt with the basics,
    record some samples, play them when you click a button.

    BUt you cant say two things at once, you have to put them after each other, yeah we go deep here.
    And as soon after you can put things after each other, I start to question.
    Oh wait what i meantt to say was, do you know how questioning sounds like ? ? ?
    right, pitches, we want to picth certain syllables.
    we want to emphasize other syllables.
    we want to write that in a simple string.
    Emphasize and pitch curving for quetsions is nice, but pitching all over the place is even better, random pitch, ratios like on a piano,
    All that jazz, swing oh wait not yet .
    Pitch and volume , that is all i can do with these samples really.
    but changuin the pitch in a wave while playing a sample gives us vibrato, and changing the pitch depending on what wa played before gives us legato.

    nice

    So yes, swing thats also something that separates us humans and creative little creatures from robots and boring stuff.
    You know what swing is? Swing is cool ! Swing is life.
    and technically its just about delaying every other sylable,

    And you know what isnt swing?
    stress.
    but it builds character, or something, is what ive heard.
    In our little system its just about auto emphasizing every nth syllabel,

    KLEMtoon klemTOON you know.

    swing-stress, well we are alomst done now.
    Some people don't just swing-stress talk there way through life though, they breath too!
    or stutter, or ..... have way too long pauses everywhere.
    So lets add all of that stuff too!

    Ok, lets have a look at the result !

    4 heads having a discussion.



script 2

Hi, i'm in need of a talking mouth
so i'm building one
Using 8 points to make a polygon
We deisgn a couple of shapes using these 8 points
and then its just interpolated or changing between these shapes

next up the language, its beatiful (i think), it's very small, it just has 39 sounds with meaning.
and you can stitch these sounds together to make more complex words.
i'm recording al the these sounds, these syllabels.
then we can string them together
into words and sentences

without intotnation everything is bland
what happens if you do'nt know something??
and what happens if you want to EMPHAsize SOMTHIN else ?

and some people are more melodic when they speak, some even sing their words in notes.
vibrato is a thing, if we're playing with picth, and so is legato

we've got some good stuff here now
but we're not done

(snips finger)
swing, like jazz. its about delaying certain syllabels.
and something not so singing sounding? stress..
they do say its build character though,
it's about emphasizing certain syllabels.

now we've got swing
and we've got stress
you also need to breath
and some people do stutter sometimes, thats ok, no worries.
and then we want a little pause

HI great that you stayd untill the end !,
I've been building this thing as a new part or component to my upcoming app,
its going to be a  follow up from mipo-puppetmaker (whcih you can download for free, no adds, no microtransactions), the mipos do talk, but a bit more primitive,
to be honest they just say mi-po a lot ;)
so thats why i built this code.
anyway, hope you enjoyed, have agood day!


ai-end

Hi.
I'm in need of a programmable talking mouth. arent we all ?
So... I'm building one.

We start by placing 8 points to make a polygon.
with those 8 points we design a few differnt shapes
and then we interpolate â€”
moving from one shape to another.

But a mouth needs more then just moving.
It needs sounds, lets call it a language.
Itâ€™s a small one â€” just 39 sounds.
And Itâ€™s pretty beautiful. (I think.)
I'll tell you more about it another time.

NOw i can  record all these 39 sounds â€” these syllables.
Once we have them,
we can string them together into words and sentences.

But without intonation?
Everything sounds bland.

So we add rising and falling intonations, or random jittery pitches here and there.

What happens if you donâ€™t know something??
Or if you want to EMPHAsize someTHING else?

Some people are more melodic when they speak â€”
some even sing their words in notes.

Vibrato becomes a thing.
And since weâ€™re playing with pitch,
adding legato makes sense too.

Weâ€™ve got some good stuff now â€”
but weâ€™re not done.

(snaps fingers)
Swing.
Like jazz.
Itâ€™s about delaying certain syllables â€” just enough to feel right.

And for contrast?
Something less musical: stress.

They say it builds character.
We'll see.
Itâ€™s about emphasizing specific syllables in a phrase.
Like KLEMtoon... not just klemtoon.

Anyway Now we've got the swing.
and sometimes We've got some stress.
Don't forget to breathe.

Some people stutter sometimes â€” thatâ€™s okay.
No worries.

And then sometimes, just to have a thought and a look...
we need some pause.

Hi! Great that you stayed until the end.
I've been building this code as a component for my upcoming app.

Itâ€™s a follow-up to Mipo Puppetmaker â€”
(which, by the way, you can download for free: no ads, no microtransactions , and its quite stylish i think).

The Mipos do talk â€”
but it's kind of primitive.

To be honest...
they mostly just say mi-po.
A lot. ðŸ˜‰

So thatâ€™s why I built this code.

Anyway â€”
hope you enjoyed it.
Have a good day!

Some people are more melodic when they speak â€”

Vibrato why not?
And since we're playing with pitch,
we'll do  legato as well.

Got some good stuff now â€”

(snaps fingers)
Swing.
Like jazz.
Itâ€™s about waiting and delaying certain syllables â€” just enough to make it feel right.

And for contrast?
Something that sounds like the opposite of swing, : stress.

They say it builds character.
Itâ€™s about emphasizing certain syllables in a phrase.
Like KLEMtoon... not just klemtoon.

Anyway.
Now weâ€™ve got swing.
And sometimes weâ€™ve got some stress.

Donâ€™t forget to breathe.

And Some people stutter sometimes â€” thatâ€™s okay.
No worries.

And then after all that
you just need to have a little rest and a thought and a lookâ€¦
we need a pause.

* oh that Moves very smooth

But a mouth needs more than just smooth movement.
It needs sound.
Letâ€™s call those sounds a language.

This language is a small one â€” just 39 sounds, or syllables.
And itâ€™s pretty beautiful. (I think.)
I'll tell you more about it another time.

For now, Iâ€™m recording all these 39 sounds.
And once we have them,
we can start stringing them together into words and even sentences.

* right, like that!, a first sentence!

Next up: intonation.
Because without it,
everything sounds bland.

We add rising and falling tones â€”

* yeah like that

or random pitch variations here and there.

* nice

What happens when you donâ€™t know something??
Or if you want to EMPHAsize someTHING else?

* thats is, much better

Some people are more melodic when they speak â€”
some even sing their words in notes.

* nice!

Vibrato â€” why not?
And since weâ€™re playing with pitch,
weâ€™ll do legato as well.

* When will we stop?, feature creep galore!

Weâ€™ve got some good stuff now â€”
but weâ€™re not done.

(snaps fingers)
Swing.
Like jazz.
Itâ€™s about waiting, and delaying certain syllables â€”
just enough to make it feel right.

* ooh yeah, it does sound much better

And for contrast?
Something that sounds like the opposite of swing: stress.

They say it builds character.
Itâ€™s about emphasizing certain syllables in a phrase.
Like KLEMtoon... not just klemtoon.

* i see i see

Anyway.
Now weâ€™ve got swing.
And sometimes weâ€™ve got some stress.

Donâ€™t forget to breathe.

* oooofgh

And some people stutter sometimes â€” thatâ€™s okay.
No worries.


And then after all that,
you just need to have a little rest,
a thought,
a lookâ€¦

We need a pause.

They just say mi and po and  pi and mo and  mi-po.
