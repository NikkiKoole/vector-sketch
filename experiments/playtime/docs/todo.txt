üß† 4. Inverse Kinematics (IK) for Dragging or Control
If you want more natural-looking control when dragging a hand or foot (rather than pulling the whole ragdoll), IK solves this better than forcing Box2D joints.

ü§ì How It Works:
You compute what the angles of each joint should be to reach a goal (e.g., mouse position). Then, either:

Apply torques to joints, or

Override body positions if you allow a non-physical solution

üõ†Ô∏è Example (2-bone limb):
Use FABRIK or CCD algorithm:

FABRIK: Moves end-effector toward goal, then solves joint angles backward

CCD: Iteratively rotates each joint to reduce distance to goal

You can find Love2D IK libraries or write a simple one like this:

lua
Copy
Edit
-- CCD for a two-link chain
-- Not real code; just logic:
for i = 1, numIterations do
  for joint = shoulder to hand do
    -- rotate joint to minimize distance from hand to mouse
  end
end
‚úÖ Benefits:
Very smooth dragging

You can mix physical simulation with procedural posing

‚ö†Ô∏è Pitfalls:
You must override Box2D‚Äôs pose (or use torque)

Can break physics realism unless blended carefully
