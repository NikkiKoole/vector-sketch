ðŸŽ¬ [the thumb comes alive, things fall, I grab a thingâ€”it falls too]
Hi, hello, wowâ€”hold onâ€”ahhâ€”shootâ€”okayâ€”anyway...
Today Iâ€™m showing you a weird little tool I built, how it grew out of an older project, and why I think it might actually be kind of a big deal.

Before we get into it, hereâ€™s a quick overview of what Iâ€™ll be talking about:

ðŸŽ¬ [on-screen list appears, no voiceover]

Why my Puppetmaker app needed a world editor

Shape building & joints

Per-level scripting

Textures & visuals

Adding characters

Rebuilding Puppetmaker inside the editor

And finally: how this lets you tell storiesâ€”not just make puppets.

1) Puppetmaker Origins
I made the very first version of Puppetmaker almost 2 years agoâ€”you mightâ€™ve tried it.

Mipo Puppetmaker is a fun tool for making characters. But they had nowhere to go.
Thatâ€™s when it hit me: puppets need a stage, but i'll get there.

You build little hand-drawn characters. That handdrawiness is important to me.
Because I hope, one day, someone tosses the iPad and grabs a real pencil.

They chaacters are physics-based. You can drag them,pull their limbs, throw them, stack them, make winegums fallâ€¦
(whispers) no idea whyâ€¦
...make them do handstands. But thatâ€™s it.

They should explore. Visit places. Endure strange contraptions. Get lost in trees.

So I started working on another app, with a procedural landscape.
Endless options for exploring i figured.
You were on a bike. In the mountains, It was weird. testing was slow. I spent hours cycling down procedural hills just to test if a cow looked ok, I got stuck, eventually I shelved it.

Thatâ€™s when I realized: I didnâ€™t need a new  game. I needed an editor.
Somewhere to draw, attach shapes, test ideas fast. Save and load stuff.

Thatâ€™s what I shouldâ€™ve been doing all along.

2) Shapes and Joints
I hooked up Box2D. Bodies, joints, physics properties. things I used to hand-code, now tweakable and fast.

It was fun:
Add a shape â†’ it bounces.
Add two â†’ connect them â†’ they flop around.

But I like messy stuff. So I added: draw *any* shape â†’ boom, itâ€™s a physics body.

Now you can build weird little levels in seconds.

3) Scripts
Once the shapes work, itâ€™s time to make them do stuff.

The visual editor saves time â€” so scripting is where i can spend that.
Write one script per level or room. No engine changes, just: script â†’ test â†’ repeat.

here are a few:

Buoyancy
Elastic blobs
Platforms
Angry birds & pigs
Planets with gravity

Suddenly you have these interactive worlds. But they still look like green vector shapesâ€¦

Time for textures.

4) Textures â€” Making It Look Like a Drawing
Right now, it still looks like a physics prototype.
I want it to look hand-drawnâ€”like Puppetmaker.

That uses OMP: made it up myself.

Outline â€” pencil strokes
Mask â€” shape silhouette
Pattern â€” texture or shading

So I brought OMP into the new tool.

Box2D doesnâ€™t do visuals, so I made Texture Fixtures â€”graphics attached to physics bodies.

Here are the main types:

Vanilla â€” a PNG attached to one shape (supports OMP and distortion with 8 vertices)

Connected-texture â€” spans across limbs using joints (like a stretchy arm)

Trace-Vertices â€” stays inside one shape, follows vertex paths (for hair)

Tile â€” repeating textures for backgrounds or clothes
(But Right now? no clothes, Still nudists.)

Now it looks like a Mipo world: scrappy, sketched, alive. still nude.

ðŸ§  5) Mipo Characters
The whole point of this editor is to give Mipos a place to live.

At the physics level, theyâ€™re just shapes and joints â€” plus a bit of custom rendering.
The editor already handles that. It can load their bodies, their textures, all of it.

But thereâ€™s another layer: their DNA.

Not biology, obviously â€” I mean their personality, their behavior, their structure.
What counts as a limb. Whether that blob is a head, a torso, or a potatohead.
How many torso segments they have. What makes them them.

Iâ€™m still figuring out how to manage and store that part â€” the deeper logic behind each Mipo.
Thereâ€™s more going on inside these characters than just shapes.

So instead of importing the old ones directly, I let the Mipos shape the tool.
I re-implemented them from scratch â€” and whenever they needed something, I added it.

Thatâ€™s why trace-vertices exist. Why connected-textures work.
Not because I planned them.
But because the Mipos â€” kind of â€” asked for them.

And then at some pointâ€¦ something flipped.

The features I added for characters turned out to be useful for the world too.
Hair systems became plants. Limb systems became ropes.

It goes both ways.

Who knows what weâ€™ll discover next.

ðŸ“Ž Quick Mentions (Before I Forget)
Softbodies â€” still figuring them out. Could be great.

Recording & Layering â€” like animation takes. Iâ€™m using it in this video!

ðŸŽ¬ Finale
So yeah, that was a ride.
And yep â€” you guessed it â€” Iâ€™ll probably rebuild the Puppetmaker app inside this editor.

Same file format, same logic.
Youâ€™ll be able to swap characters into any new game I make.

But more importantly â€” building weird worlds for these puppets is finally fun.

And maybe that was the point all along:

To play.
To make.
To see what happens.

Letâ€™s see where it takes us.
Letâ€™s see what happens next with Puppetmaker.
