You know the NPC meme right?

these bland figures, made to assist the main characters storyline.
vanilla .

Or this mario guy, the biggest game character on this planet, this galaxy even
always happy, almost never any other emotion.

I' might be missing something, but i feel i can do better:

I have these characters, and i have a bit of a lipsyncing system in place,
I've been postponing the face parts and expressions for this video.

Also i'll be building a system where a character likes and dislikes certain objects/environments/other characters/anything
so it can trigger emotional repsonses to things happening in the world.

My characters aren't really main-caharcters or npc's for that matter, there is a world there are stationary characters, made to pick up and play with.
Like how you play with your toys.
