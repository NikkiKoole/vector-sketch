Hi, hello.
You’ve seen the NPC memes, right?
The ones where the characters just loop three lines like a broken microwave?
“Nice weather.” “Be careful out there.” “I lost my sheep.”
Same three responses. Forever.

In my upcoming game… every character is an NPC.
No main characters.
Equal oppurtunities for all!
And I want them to be… emotional.

Not “Ow.” when you bump them.
I mean full-spectrum, messy, human-like feelings.
Jealousy, pride, embarrassment. those kinda things.
Tears in their eyes because someone stole their snack. Again.

Ok so where to start?

we will start with basic needs the character can have, I have found this code, written by Don Hopkins, the head programmer of the original Sims 1, it's called the soul of the Sims, it's written in C, its agood start for this project.
