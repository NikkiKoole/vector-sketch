Hi hello there.

today we make a little language, and have our little mipos speak it too!

this started with existing app. show

mathematical bezier line upperlip lowerlip

realise lip syncing, shapes of mouths.

think aha, what if my language is specifically easy to lipsync

so alway start with consonat and then vowel.

then i figure hey they are called mipo, that should mean something, mi means I or Me that makes sense and then po menas to give

ok lets make a full table of consonant  i want to use, that start the syllabels M,B,P,F,K,L,T,J,N,D,S,H,W
and we have these vowels after them, A I O
that gives a totla of 39 syllables.

i was feeling wild so at this point i also added U/OE and AI  (so i could have my company name mi-po-lai) mean something
combinattional explosion 13 * 5 = 65 samples to record. a messy categoru and lots of weird overlaps.

```

so i decide to trim, you have to kill your darlings.
the AI and OE sounds had to go.

the broot syllables specificallyaboutpooping adn farting also needed to go (who knows they might come back)

we are left with just 13 * 3 syllabels = 39 much easier to sample and reaosn about and oversee :

```

ok now we have a basic idea and a bunch of syllabels, lets record a few and see if i can get some sound fron the computer


- play a singel sample on a keypress

- have a say('') function where i can type something that will be said.
'mi-po pi-pi'

we are monophonic so you just say one tyhing after another.
little pause between syllables, bigger pause between words, add a rest ','
think about ? that pitches up,
words usually have ephasize on some part, usuallyth efirst, so i need to be able to say a syllable emphasized and not emphasized

 ok so lets do
 CAPS for emphasized parts like 'MI-po'
 then i figured we might also want some singing
 so you can add a note arker before the thing liek:

 '[c3]MI-po'

 play frere jaques

 what is left, vibrato, picthing up pitching dowmn, oh yes reusing the bezier curves knowledge, use a bezier curve as a picth curvature for a syllabels

 a little preset config object talking about the root note of a said thing, that enables notes to also be defined relative in semitones:
 '[-1]MI-po' or fracyional even todo microtonal things: '[-.5]MI-po'

 in that same config object we can do some randomizers, so we can type '{rnd=3} mi mi mi' asn say mi three times with a radnomizer that goes up and down 3 semitone, so every mi can sound differnt higher/lower.


 legato, stress,

 thinking more baout notation:
 ```

-- ma     = normal
-- MA     = emphasized
-- ma!    = louder (1.25)
-- ma!!   = very loud (1.5)
-- ma<    = soft (0.75)
-- ma<<   = whisper (0.5)
-- Marker	Effect
-- !	Loud
-- !!	Very Loud
-- <	Soft
-- <<	Whisper
-- ~	Legato glide
-- '	Clipped / Glottal / Cutoff
-- -	(Stutter / pre-played repeat?)
-- ?	Question rise
-- MA	Emphasis
-- Ma/mA	Tone direction
 ```

 doing more on the language itself, being tempted to add the 'oe' sound, because it sounds so great when toddlers do it .

 but not usefull..

 ```

 things can be described without it, and you know keep it simple stupid!


thinking about the issue with recorded syllabels, being not of the same note, they need to be offsetted.
also thining about dirrent elongated sounds like miiiiii-po or mi-poooo etc, also thinkinga bout whispering and shouting to be separate recorded samples with their own timbre.

combinationbal explosion incoming again.

i need to see if i can separate the consonatnt from the voewels, record tehm separately and mix or something.

ok to be coninued
